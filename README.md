I try and follow William Lam's [blog](https://williamlam.com) regularly even though much of it goes over my head. When Tanzu Community Edition was released, I really wanted to be able to install it on my homelab and hoped he would release something. After some trial and error trying to decide which pieces of his previous [post](https://williamlam.com/2020/11/complete-vsphere-with-tanzu-homelab-with-just-32gb-of-memory.html) were relevant, I found his new post on [installing vcsa without dns and ntp](https://williamlam.com/2021/10/can-you-really-deploy-the-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-without-dns-and-ntp.html) and realized I could greatly simplify the entire process.

This repo is a result of that effort, as well as some more learnings on the vSphere CLI to script the creation of folders for organizing TCE.

For the Tanzu Community Edition (TCE) install pieces, I followed the official documentation. https://tanzucommunityedition.io/docs/latest/vsphere-intro/

The step by step guide to using this repo is broken out [here](lightning-lab-steps.md).

NOTE: If you run the CLI version of the management-cluster installer, you will see the below message. It's not as obvious using the Browser-based installed but this repo is installing Tanzu Community Edition on vSphere _in a non-integrated way_.

```text
vSphere 7.0 Environment Detected.

You have connected to a vSphere 7.0 environment which does not have vSphere with Tanzu enabled. vSphere with Tanzu includes
an integrated Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service which turns a vSphere cluster into a platform for running Kubernetes workloads in dedicated
resource pools. Configuring Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service is done through vSphere HTML5 client.

Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service is the preferred way to consume Tanzu Kubernetes Grid in vSphere 7.0 environments. Alternatively you may
deploy a non-integrated Tanzu Kubernetes Grid instance on vSphere 7.0.
Note: To skip the prompts and directly deploy a non-integrated Tanzu Kubernetes Grid instance on vSphere 7.0, you can set the 'DEPLOY_TKG_ON_VSPHERE7' configuration variable to 'true'
```

You can continue using the CLI installer by running it with the environment variable `DEPLOY_TKG_ON_VSPHERE7=true tanzu management-cluster create -f management.yaml`
